# I'm a Computer Science student at Rutgers University (New Brunswick)

I'm passionate about **cybersecurity**, **automation**, and **systems administration**, and I focus on building practical tools that solve real-world problems. I enjoy working with Linux, scripting, and backend infrastructure, and I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies and improve my technical skills.

## Featured Projects

### Portable Virus Scanner
A cross-platform malware detection tool designed for portability and offline use.

- Uses hash and pattern-based detection along with archive scanning (ZIP, RAR, 7z)
- Interactive command-line shell with real-time scan progress
- Generates detailed scan reports (TXT/JSON)
- Supports signature updates from MalwareBazaar and custom plugin extensions
- Runs directly from USB with no installation required  
**Tech:** `Python`, `argparse`, `hashlib`, `regex`, `archive handling`, `logging`, `JSON`

### Music Metadata Generator & Downloader
Automates music file downloading and metadata tagging using public sources.

- Fetches YouTube links based on song info and downloads audio via `yt-dlp`
- Applies complete metadata: artist, album, genre, high-res album art
- Supports manual input, preset lists, CSV, and JSON formats
- Organizes downloaded files into clean project directories  
**Tech:** `Python`, `yt-dlp`, `mutagen`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`

### Image Encryption Tool
A secure Java-based application for encrypting and decrypting image files.

- Implements AES encryption with Base64 key serialization
- CLI interface with metadata-aware image handling and search functions
- Demonstrates knowledge of Javaâ€™s cryptography and I/O libraries  
**Tech:** `Java`, `AES`, `Base64`, `OOP`, `File I/O`
